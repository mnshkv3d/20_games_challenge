# 20 Games Challenge  

🎮 This repository tracks my progress in the **[20 Games Challenge](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/challenge/)**.
## 📌 About  
Each game is stored as a **Git submodule** in its own separate repository.

## 🕹️ Completed Games  
✅ **[Flappy Plane](https://mnshkv.itch.io/flappyplane)** – A Flappy Bird clone made with **Godot**. ([Source Code](https://github.com/mnshkv3d/01_FlappyPlane))  

More games coming soon! 🚀
